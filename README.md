this is just part of the site, only problem i have now is that idk how to unpackage the class UserInfo from app.py to database.py, both work okay separately, i can get the user data info app.py and the database connects to Postgres, its just not getting the data into the database


'NoneType' object has no attribute 'name' --- is the first error code i get when initaizling the website 



TypeError: create_database() takes 0 positional arguments but 5 were given --- is there error code i get when i try to pass in data from the localhost website
